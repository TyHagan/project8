## *** BEGIN pruning the repo of cache files and figurong out .gitignore ***
## I think we have checked in generated files and want to exclude those.  We will have to figure that out
## KH - 9/24/19 - I have deleted a number of cache and other files.  
## I think the remaining files should be excluded via a .gitignore file, but I am going to pause here while I test more and other dev envs get setup
## here is the current git status on my machine after opening a clean project8
